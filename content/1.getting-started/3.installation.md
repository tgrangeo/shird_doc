## Installation

::steps

### Add it to pubspec

Add the dependency inside your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml [pubspec.yaml]
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  shird:
````

### Run pub get

```bash [Terminal]
flutter pub get
```

You’re now ready to go — let’s instantiate it!
### First Instantiation

#### You must declare an instance of `Shird` to start using it.

In the next steps, we’ll go through what each part does and why you need to define them.

### Declaration

You must declare an instance of `Shird` before you can use it properly:

```ts [example.dart]
final shird = Shird(
  loginEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/login",
  refreshEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/refresh",
);
```

* **`loginEndpoint`** — your API endpoint for local login (email or username + password).
* **`refreshEndpoint`** — endpoint used by **Shird** to automatically refresh tokens when they expire.


### HTTP Client

To make POST and GET requests, you must define a client and attach it to the provider.
Learn more [here](/getting-started/auth_client).

```ts [example.dart]
final shird = Shird(
  loginEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/login",
  refreshEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/refresh",
  // ⬇️⬇️⬇️
  client: AuthClient(),
);
```

### Token Storage

To persist authentication tokens, you must define a storage strategy and attach it to the provider.
Learn more [here](/getting-started/token_storage).

```ts [example.dart]
final shird = Shird(
  loginEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/login",
  refreshEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/refresh",
  client: AuthClient(),
  // ⬇️⬇️⬇️
  storage: SharedPrefsTokenStorage(),
);
```

### Next Steps

Now that your `Shird` is set up, you can start using it to manage authentication.
