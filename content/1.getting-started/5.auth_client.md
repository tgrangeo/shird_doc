## Create Your HTTP Client

To make network requests, **Shird** requires an HTTP client implementation.
This design gives you full flexibility — you can use **Dio**, **http**, **Chopper**, or any other client you prefer.

You simply need to implement the `AuthClient` abstraction.

::prose-steps

### Base Interface

Here’s the base structure of the client:

```ts [auth_client.dart]
/// Base abstraction for any HTTP client used by Shird.
/// This allows developers to inject Dio, http, Chopper, etc.
abstract class AuthClient {
  /// Executes a POST request.
  Future<dynamic> post(
    String url, {
    Map<String, dynamic>? data,
    Map<String, String>? headers,
  });

  /// Executes a GET request.
  Future<HttpResponse> get(String url, {Map<String, String>? headers});
}

/// A generic response returned by any IHttpClient implementation.
class HttpResponse {
  final int statusCode;
  final Map<String, dynamic>? data;

  HttpResponse(this.statusCode, this.data);
}
```

### Why You Need It

**Shird** uses this abstraction to perform login, refresh, and token validation requests.
By creating your own implementation, you can choose the networking package and behavior that best fit your app.

### Example: Using Dio

Here’s a simple example of how to implement it using **Dio**:

```ts [dio_client.dart]
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'auth_client.dart';

class DioAuthClient implements AuthClient {
  final Dio _dio = Dio();

  @override
  Future<dynamic> post(
    String url, {
    Map<String, dynamic>? data,
    Map<String, String>? headers,
  }) async {
    final response = await _dio.post(url, data: data, options: Options(headers: headers));
    return response.data;
  }

  @override
  Future<HttpResponse> get(String url, {Map<String, String>? headers}) async {
    final response = await _dio.get(url, options: Options(headers: headers));
    return HttpResponse(response.statusCode ?? 0, response.data);
  }
}
```

### Next Steps

Once your client is ready, pass it to your `AuthProvider` instance:

```ts [example.dart]
final authProvider = AuthProvider(
  loginEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/login",
  refreshEndpoint: "http://localhost:3000/auth/refresh",
  client: DioAuthClient(),
);
```

Now your provider can send authenticated requests using your chosen HTTP library.
