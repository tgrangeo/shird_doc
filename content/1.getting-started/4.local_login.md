## Login

::steps

### Simple Login Flow

Once you’ve instantiated your `Shird`, logging in is as simple as calling the `login` method.
This method handles the API call, token storage, and automatic refresh setup for you.

  ::prose-steps

  ### Example

  Here’s a minimal example showing how to log in using an email and password:

  ```ts [example.dart]
  await Shird.login(
    email: "admin@test.com",
    password: "123",
  );
  ```

  ### How It Works

  * **`email`** and **`password`** are sent to your defined `loginEndpoint`.
  * The provider automatically stores the received token using your configured storage.
  * Session persistence and token refresh are handled seamlessly in the background.


  ### Next Steps

  You can now:

  * Access the user’s authentication state through your provider.
  * Make authenticated API requests with your configured client.
  * Explore the next section to see how to **refresh tokens** and **handle session persistence**.
