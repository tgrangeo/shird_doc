## Introduction

The **WebView login method** provides an embedded browser interface to handle OAuth or SSO authentication flows inside your Flutter app.
It is ideal for providers such as **Microsoft** or **Apple**, where the authentication process requires navigating through multiple redirects before reaching the callback URL.

This implementation is provided by the package **`shird_webview_flutter`**.


## Installation

Add the package to your project by referencing it directly from Git:

```yaml
shird_webview_flutter:
  git:
    url: https://gitlab.xefi.fr/xefi/xefi-interne/flutter_auth_provider
    path: packages/shird_webview_flutter
    ref: v0.1.2
```

Then, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

Import the WebView login launcher into your project:

```ts
import 'package:shird_webview_flutter/launch_login_webview.dart';
```

When declaring your **Shird** instance, assign the WebView launcher to the `launchLogin` property:

```ts
final shird = Shird(
  providers: {
    microsoft: MicrosoftProvider(
      loginUrl: EnvironmentService.microsoftSsoUrl,
      callbackUrl: EnvironmentService.oauthCallbackUrl,
      navigatorKey: NavigationService.navigatorKey,
    ),
  },
  // ⬇️ Use the WebView-based login method
  launchLogin: launchLoginWebview,
);
```

## Behavior

When `launchLoginWebview` is used:

* It opens a **WebView** inside the app.
* Loads the `loginUrl` provided by the provider.
* Waits until the **callback URL** is reached.
* Extracts cookies or tokens from the session.
* Returns them to the provider, which completes the authentication flow.


## Notes

* The WebView requires **JavaScript** and **cookies** to be enabled for authentication to work correctly.
* Make sure to provide the same **callback URL** that your provider (e.g., Microsoft or Apple) is configured with.
* The WebView automatically closes itself by calling `Navigator.pop(cookieMap)` when the authentication is complete.
