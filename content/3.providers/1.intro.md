## Introduction

In **Shird**, authentication flows are organized through **providers**.
Each provider defines its own login and callback URLs, and optionally uses navigation for handling authentication within a webview.

Shird includes built-in providers for popular identity systems such as **Microsoft** and **Apple**, but also allows you to create your own custom providers with minimal setup.


## Built-in Providers

To enable a provider, declare it during your Shird initialization:

```ts
microsoft: MicrosoftProvider(
loginUrl: EnvironmentService.microsoftSsoUrl,
callbackUrl: EnvironmentService.oauthCallbackUrl,
navigatorKey: NavigationService.navigatorKey,
),

apple: AppleProvider(
loginUrl: EnvironmentService.appleSsoUrl,
callbackUrl: EnvironmentService.oauthCallbackUrl,
navigatorKey: NavigationService.navigatorKey,
),
```

Once declared, you can easily trigger an authentication flow:

```ts
await shird.authWith.microsoft();
```


## Custom Providers

You can define your own providers by implementing the `Shird` interface.

```ts
abstract class Shird {
final String loginUrl;
final String callbackUrl;
final String webviewTitle;

Shird({
required this.loginUrl,
required this.callbackUrl,
required this.webviewTitle,
});

Future<Map<String, String>?> login(
AuthClient client,
Future<Map<String, String>?> Function({
required String loginUrl,
required String callbackUrl,
required String title,
GlobalKey<NavigatorState>? navigatorKey,
})
launchLogin,
);
}

/// Optional mixin for providers that need navigation (e.g. Microsoft)
mixin NavigableProvider on Shird {
GlobalKey<NavigatorState>? navigatorKey;
}
```

### Example Declaration

You can add your custom provider to the Shird configuration like this:

```ts
custom: [
{
'myCustomProvider':
Shird(
loginUrl: 'https://my-sso.com/login',
callbackUrl: 'https://my-app.com/callback',
webviewTitle: 'My Custom Login',
)
},
],
```

Then authenticate using your provider:

```ts
await shird.authWith.custom('myCustomProvider');
```
